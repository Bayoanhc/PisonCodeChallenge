# PisonCodeChallenge

###Background
For this coding challenge, your task will be to implement a TCP client that receives JSON data from a local server and classifies the data. This data vaguely resembles the data received from a Pison device. Your task is to classify “activations” and send a message back over TCP every time you think you’ve classified an activation.

###Instructions SERVER
Run the jar from the command-line like so: 
java -jar .\challenge-0.1.0.jar

The server will print out the TCP port that it is writing data to.


###Instructions CLIENT
